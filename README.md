In and out of transit starspot modeling code

V4.5.1 2015-12-07

Refactoring the elapsed time calculation for timed runs. STSP runs can be timed by 
setting the MCMC step number to a negative number, which will be interpreted as the
negative of the maximum number of seconds to run the chains. 

V4.5    2015-11-30

Added the functionality for analyzing planets on eccentric orbits.
The input file has not changed and requires input of ecosw and esinw
which are the orthogal observable quantities.  The program should
calculate the orbit of the planet based on the new orbital parameters.

V4.4.3  2015-07-15

Added a #define to use latitude and R * sin(latitute) as the parameters of interest instead of R and latitude (R=radius of spot)
to make the parameters more orthogonal.  This functionality will not help make parameters more orthogonal when
star and planet are misaligned

Added the initial random values of parameters to output mcmc.txt file as step 0

V4.4.2  2015-04-08

L & G fixed bug in combining solutions from the walkers, which should help speed up convergence.


### NOTE
The default mode should have these flags set in the top of the code, which improves speed during the MCMC solutions being run in bulk.

    #define QUIET 1
    #define QUIETMCMC 1
    #define ANYPRINTVIS 0
    
To get the optional visaulization outputs to work (action L), change them to this and recompile STSP:

    #define QUIET 0
    #define QUIETMCMC 0   // optional
    #define ANYPRINTVIS 1



V4.4.1  2014-09-09

Light curve file now has an extra column that identifies which starspots 
are interacting with the planet at each time step.  The column is
a binary number where:  
no spot-planet overlap = 0
spot0 overlaps with planet = +1
spot1 overlaps with planet = +2
spot k overlaps with planet = +2^k

To turn the number, n, to a string of 0/1 digits:
Loop over the number of spots (or the number of digits in the n)
For the ith digit:
  (1) k = n mod 2
  (2) spot_flag[i] = k   (this should be 1 or 0)
  (3) n = (n - k)/2   (subtract 1 and divide by 2)

V4.4  2014-05-23

Fixed bug related to combine 1 spot
Added functionality to injest a flattened light curve and to flat the models
Added functionality to use if fixed longitude mode

V4.33  2014-05-06

Change sigma value for brightness factor from 0.1 --> 0.001
that is used during seeded runs.

V4.32  2014-04-23

Puts a filecheck on the input file.  Bug fix for name of errstsp.txt filename.

V4.31  2014-03-21

Added bug fix that corrects problem with combining
across phi =0-->2pi boundary when in fixed latitude mode

V4.3

Added new fitted parameter, Brightness_ratio,
that corrects the normalization of the input light curve

V4.21 2014-01-14

Bug fix to program JRAD encountered in Baltimore when large spot & planet at very limb of star as spot rotating out
of view.

V4.2 of the starspot program

2013-12-18

Lastest starspot program.  Added two new functionalities
  -- allows for fixing the latitudes for the spots
  -- allows misaligned planet & star with lambda parameter

to compile

gcc -lm stsp.c -o stsp

to run

stsp  stsp_kepler17_starspot.in

New input file:

The input file for stsp has the following structure:

    --- THE REMAINING LINES DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF THE ACTION PARAMETER --

    If the ACTION is set to M, then the following lines need to be random seed, scale factor, number of changes,
    #ACTION
    M              ; M= unseeded mcmc
    74384338       ; random seed
    1.25000        ; ascale
    40             ; number of chains
    5000           ; mcmc steps
    1              ; 1= combine one spot at a time, 0= combine all spots.
    
    If the ACTION is set to l or s, then the following lines need to give the radius (0.0-->1.0), latitude (in radians) and longitude (in radians) for each spot.
    For example, for 3 spots and to generate the light curve only, the following lines of the input file would read:
    # ACTION
    l
    0.220
    2.457
    3.829
    0.418
    1.955
    4.791
    0.157
    1.533
    0.021

    # ACTION
