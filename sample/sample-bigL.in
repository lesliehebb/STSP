#PLANET PROPERTIES
1			; Number of planets -- (if there are more than 1 planet, then the set of 8 planet properties are repeated)
1.0			; T0, epoch         (middle of first transit) in days.
1.5			; Planet Period      (days)
0.0038688		; (Rp/Rs)^2         (Rplanet / Rstar )^ 2
0.120			; Duration (days)   (physical duration of transit, not used)
0.732			; Impact parameter  (0= planet cross over equator)
90.0			; Inclination angle of orbit (90 deg = planet crosses over equator)
0.0			; Lambda of orbit (0 deg = orbital axis along z-axis)
0.0			; ecosw
0.0			; esinw
#STAR PROPERTIES
1.3450000		; Mean Stellar density (Msun/Rsun^3)
12.0			; Stellar Rotation period (days)
5576			; Stellar Temperature
0.0			; Stellar metallicity
0.0			; Tilt of the rotation axis of the star down from z-axis (degrees)
0.5742 -0.2175 0.8311 -0.4144	; Limb darkening (4 coefficients)
100			; number of rings for limb darkening appoximation
#SPOT PROPERTIES
6				; number of spots
0.70				; fractional lightness of spots (0.0=total dark, 1.0=same as star)
#LIGHT CURVE
model_lc.dat			; light curve input data file (only used to get times for generating lightcurve)
0.0				; start time to start fitting the light curve
12.00000			; duration of light curve to fit (days)
996.942768414			; real maximum of light curve data (corrected for noise), 0 -> use downfrommax	
0				; is light curve flattened (to zero) outside of transits?
#ACTION
L			; L= generate light curve from parameter file
sample_parambest.txt	; file name for parameter file
